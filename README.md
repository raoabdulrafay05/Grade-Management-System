# Grade-Management-System
The Grade Management System is a tool designed to facilitate the management of student grades. By uploading a spreadsheet containing student grades, the system computes grades based on relative-to-absolute grading scales and saves the updated grades to a new Excel file.

Features:
Input: Upload an Excel spreadsheet with student grades.
Processing: The system computes grades based on both mean and standard deviation for relative grading.
Output: The updated grades are saved to a new Excel file for easy download.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: The user interface is created by Niaz Ali to ensure a smooth and friendly user experience.
Backend:
Python: The backend is implemented using Python.
Pandas: Used for data extraction and manipulation (e.g., calculating the mean, standard deviation, and applying grading logic).
Flask: Powers the web application and handles communication between the frontend and backend.
JSON: Used for implementing JavaScript functionality and managing data interchange in the system.
